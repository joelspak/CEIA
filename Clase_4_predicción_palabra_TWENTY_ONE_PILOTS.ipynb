Ah Yeah I\\'m a goner Somebody catch my breath I\\'m a goner Somebody catch my breath I wanna be known by you I wanna be known by you I wake up fine and dandy But then by the time I find it handy To rip my heart apart and start Planning my crash landing I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling Then I feel my soul start leaving Like an old man\\'s hair receding I\\'m pleading: Please, oh please! On my knees repeatedly asking Why it\\'s got to be like this Is this living free? I don\\'t wanna be the one Be the one to have the sun\\'s blood on my hands I\\'ll tell the moon Take this weapon, forged in darkness Some see a pen, I see harpoon I\\'ll stay awake Cause the dark\\'s not taking prisoners tonight Why am I not scared in the morning? I don\\'t hear those voices calling I must have kicked them out I must have kicked them out I swear I heard demons yelling Those crazy words they were spelling They told me I was gone They told me I was gone But I tell \\'em Why won\\'t you let me go? Do I threaten all your plans? I\\'m insignificant Please tell \\'em You have no plans for me I will set my soul on fire What have I become? I\\'ll tell \\'em On the eve of a day that\\'s forgotten and fake As the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate The start of a day when we put on our face A mask that portrays that we don\\'t need grace On the eve of a day that is bigger than us But we open our eyes, cause we\\'re told that we must And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead Desperately yelling: There\\'s something we need! I\\'m not free, I Asked forgiveness three times Same amount that I denied I three-time MVP\\'d this crime I\\'m afraid to tell you who I adore Won\\'t tell you who I\\'m singing towards Metaphorically, I\\'m a whore And that\\'s denial number four I\\'ll stay awake Cause the dark\\'s not taking prisoners tonight Why am I not scared in the morning? I don\\'t hear those voices calling I must have kicked them out I must have kicked them out I swear I heard demons yelling Those crazy words they were spelling They told me I was gone They told me I was gone But I tell \\'em Why won\\'t you let me go?

Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat Shadows will scream that I\\'m alone I-I-I\\'ve got a migraine And my pain will range from up down and sideways Thank God it\\'s Friday \\'Cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays \\'Cause Sunday\\'s are my suicide days I don\\'t know why they always seem so dismal Thunderstorms, cloud, snow, and a slight drizzle Whether it\\'s the weather or the letters by my bed Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head Let it be said what the headache represents It\\'s me defending in suspense, it\\'s me suspended in a defenseless Test being tested by a ruthless examiner That\\'s represented best by my depressing thoughts I do not have writers block My writer just hates the clock It will not let me sleep, I\\'ll get some sleep when I\\'m dead And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head Am I the only one I know? Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat Shadows will scream that I\\'m alone But I know we\\'ve made it this far, kid Yeah, yeah, yeah I am not as fine as I seem pardon Me for yelling I\\'m telling you green gardens Are not what\\'s growing in my psyche It\\'s a different me A difficult to be, stop feasting lumber down trees Freeze frame Please let me paint a mental picture portrait Something you won\\'t forget, it\\'s all about my forehead Deny what is important, holds back contents That make Pandora\\'s box contents look non-violent Behind my eyelids are islands of violence My mind shipwrecked, this is the only land my mind could find I did not know it was such a violent island Bullet tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions They\\'re trying to eat me blood running down their chin And they know that I can fight or I can let the lion win I begin to assemble what weapons I can find \\'Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind Am I the only one I know?

Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat Shadows will scream that I\\'m alone But I know we\\'ve made it this far, kid We\\'ve made it this far, we\\'ve made it this... I ponder of something great My lungs will fill and then deflate They fill with fire, exhale desire I know it\\'s dire my time today I have these thoughts, so often I ought To replace that slot with what I once bought \\'Cause somebody stole my car radio And now I just sit in silence Sometimes quiet is violent I find it hard to hide it My pride is no longer inside It\\'s on my sleeve My skin will scream reminding me of Who I killed inside my dream I hate this car that I\\'m driving There\\'s no hiding for me I\\'m forced to deal with what I feel There is no distraction to mask what is real I could pull the steering wheel I have these thoughts, so often I ought To replace that slot with what I once bought \\'Cause somebody stole my car radio And now I just sit in silence I ponder of something terrifying \\'Cause this time there\\'s no sound to hide behind I find over the course of our human existence One thing consists of consistence And it\\'s that we\\'re all battling fear Oh dear, I don\\'t know if we know why we\\'re here Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking I liked it better when my car had sound There are things we can do But from the things that work there are only two And from the two that we choose to do Peace will win and fear will lose It is faith and there\\'s sleep We need to pick one please because Faith is to be awake And to be awake is for us to think And for us to think is to be alive And I will try with every rhyme To come across like I am dying To let you know you need to try to think I have these thoughts, so often I ought To replace that slot with what I once bought \\'Cause somebody stole my car radio And now I just sit in silence And now I just sit in silence And now I just sit And now I just sit in silence And now I just sit in silence And now I just sit in silence And now I just sit I ponder of something great My lungs will fill and then deflate They fill with fire, exhale desire I know it\\'s dire my time today I have these thoughts, so often I ought To replace that slot with what I once bought \\'Cause somebody stole my car radio And now I just sit in silence I know where you stand Silent in the trees And thats where I am Silent in the trees Why won\\'t you speak Where I happen to be?

Either way he can\\'t deny he is a pantaloon You are tired, you are hurt A moth ate through your favorite shirt And all your friends fertilize The ground you walk Lose your mind You like to sleep alone It\\'s colder than you know \\'Cause your skin is so Used to colder bones It\\'s warmer in the morning Than what it is at night Your bones are held together by your nightmare and your frights You are tired, you are hurt A moth ate through your favorite shirt And all your friends, they fertilize The ground you walk So lose your mind You are tired, you are hurt A moth ate through your favorite shirt And all your friends, they fertilize The ground you walk Lose your mind I wanna fall inside your ghost And fill up every hole inside my mind And I want everyone to know That I am half a soul divided Sometimes we will die and sometimes we will fly away Either way you\\'re by my side until my dying days And if I\\'m not there and I\\'m far away I said, don\\'t be afraid I said, don\\'t be afraid We\\'re going home I wanna strip myself of breath A breathless beast of death I\\'ve made for you A mortal writing piece of song Will help me carry on But these you heard Sometimes we will die and sometimes we will fly away Either way you\\'re by my side until my dying days And if I\\'m not there and I\\'m far away I said, don\\'t be afraid I said, don\\'t be afraid We\\'re going home So the hearse ran out of gas A passenger purse and grabbed a map And the driver inside it contrived a new route to save the past And checked his watch and grabbed a cab A beautifully planned taxi cab A cab, had it cleared out back And two men started to unpack Driving once again But now this time there were three men And then I heard one of them say I know the night will turn to gray I know the stars will start to fade When all the darkness fades away We had to steal him from his fate So he could see another day Then I cracked open my box Someone must have picked the lock A little light revealed the spot Where my fingernails had fought Then I pushed it open more, Pushing up against the door Then I sat up off the floor And found the breath I was searching for Then there were three men up front All I saw were backs of heads And then I asked them am I alive and well or am I dreaming dead And then one turned around to say We\\'re driving toward the morning sun Where all your blood is washed away And all you did will be undone I said, don\\'t be afraid I said, don\\'t be afraid Open the slits in your face and start your day You don\\'t have much time to make your slits look just right I\\'m in your mind I\\'m singing I\\'m in your mind I\\'m singing La da, la da, la da, la da, la da, la da Look in the mirror and ask your soul if you\\'re alright Put out the glitter that your soul hides behind You\\'re in my mind I\\'m singing You\\'re in my mind I\\'m singing La da, la da, la da, la da, la da, la da Nowhere were they holy Open up your eyes and see The clouds above will hold you The clouds above will sing And in your mind You\\'re singing La da, la da, la da, la da, la da, la da Hello, we haven\\'t talked in quite some time I know, I haven\\'t been the best of sons Hello, I\\'ve been traveling in the deserts of my mind And I haven\\'t found a drop Of life I haven\\'t found a drop of you I haven\\'t found a drop I haven\\'t found a drop Of water Water I try desperately to run through the sand As I hold the water in the palm of my hand \\'Cause it\\'s all that I have And it\\'s all that I need and The waves of the water mean nothing to me But I try my best and all that I can to Hold tightly onto What\\'s left in my hand But no matter how How tightly I will strain The sand will slow me down And the water will drain I\\'m just being dramatic In fact, I\\'m only at it again As an addict with a pen Who\\'s addicted to the wind as it blows me back and forth Mindless, spineless, and pretend Of course, I\\'ll be here again See you tomorrow But it\\'s the end of today End of my ways as a walking denial My trial was filed as a crazy, suicidal head-case But you specialize in dying You hear me screaming \"Father!\" And I\\'m lying here just crying So wash me with your water Water Hello, we haven\\'t talked in quite some time I know, I haven\\'t been the best of sons Hello, I\\'ve been traveling in the deserts of my mind And I haven\\'t found a drop Of life I haven\\'t found a drop of you I haven\\'t found a drop I haven\\'t found a drop Of water'"
